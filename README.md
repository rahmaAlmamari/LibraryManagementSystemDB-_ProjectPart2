# **Developer Reflection**

## **1. What part was hardest and why?**

Honestly, there were some parts that required extra focus and effort from me, 
but in the end, I was able to overcome them. One of the most challenging 
aspects was aligning the requirements with my database, which led me to 
create some tables and modify others to meet the specifications. Additionally, 
there were occasional errors due to the precision and strict conditions of the task. 
Overall, it was a valuable experience that allowed me to test and apply 
what I’ve learned over the past period.

## **2. Which concept helped them think like a backend dev?**
